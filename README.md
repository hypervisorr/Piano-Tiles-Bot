**Project: Piano Tiles Bot with scrcpy**  
Automate "Piano Tiles" on Android using scrcpy for screen control.  

**Setup:**  
1. **Enable USB Debugging:**  
   - Go to `Settings > About Phone` > Tap "Build Number" 7 times.  
   - Enable `USB Debugging` in `Developer Options`.  

2. **Install scrcpy:**  
   - Download [scrcpy-win64-v3.3.1.zip](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/releases) and unzip it (e.g., `C:\scrcpy`).  

3. **(Optional) Modded App:**  
   - Use a modded APK (e.g., "Piano Tiles 3™ Mod") to avoid ads. *Use at your own risk.*  

**Usage:**  
1. Connect your phone via USB and allow debugging.  
2. Run in cmd:  
   ```bash
   py piano-tiles-bot.py
   ```  
   The bot auto-detects the scrcpy window. Start it and play a song!
